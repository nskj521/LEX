# Lex

Lex is a **lightweight, simple, and terminal-based text editor**, inspired by GNU Nano. It aims to provide a clean, responsive, and distraction-free editing experience for developers who prefer to stay in the terminal. Unlike full-featured IDEs, Lex focuses on simplicity and essential features only.

## 📦 Installation

This project uses **CMake** for the build and installation process, replacing traditional shell scripts.

### Requirements

* C compiler (GCC or Clang)
* CMake 3.15+
* Make or other CMake-compatible build tool

### Build and Install

Follow these steps to build and install Lex on your system:

| Step | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1. Clone Repository | `git clone https://github.com/danko1122q/LEX.git && cd LEX` | Clone the project and navigate to its directory |
| 2. Create Build Directory | `mkdir build` | Create a build directory in the project root |
| 3. Enter Build Directory | `cd build` | Navigate into the build directory |
| 4. Configure Project | `cmake ..` | Generate makefiles and create `install_manifest.txt` |
| 5. Compile | `make -j$(nproc)` | Compile the source code using all available CPU cores |
| 6. Install System-wide | `sudo make install` | Copy the executable to system directory (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`). Requires root access |

**Quick Installation (One-liner):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danko1122q/lex.git && cd lex && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j$(nproc) && sudo make install
```

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

The `uninstall` target is created using CMake. This is the recommended method to remove the installed executable from your system.

| Step | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1. Enter Build Directory | `cd build` | Navigate to the directory where you ran the installation |
| 2. Run Uninstall | `sudo make uninstall .` | Uses the stored file list (`install_manifest.txt`) to remove each installed item. Requires root access |

**Example:**

```bash
cd /path/to/LEX/build
sudo make uninstall .
```

**Note:** The uninstall process reads from `install_manifest.txt` which is automatically generated during the CMake configuration step. Make sure this file exists before running the uninstall command.

---

## 🧹 Deep Clean (Purge)

The `purge` target removes the entire `build` directory (including CMake cache, object files, makefiles, and local executables). This is useful after uninstallation or when you want to start the build process from scratch.

| Step | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1. Enter Build Directory | `cd build` | Navigate to the directory to be cleaned |
| 2. Run Purge | `make purge` | Removes all contents in the `/build` directory |

**Example:**

```bash
cd /path/to/LEX/build
make purge
```

**Note:** After running `purge`, the build directory will be completely removed. You'll need to repeat the installation steps from the beginning if you want to rebuild the project.

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run Lex from your terminal:

```bash
lex [filename]
```

If no filename is given, a new empty buffer will open.

### Interface Overview

* **Editor Area** — Main text input and editing area
* **Status Bar** — Displays file name, cursor position, and quick help
* **Command Line (Optional)** — Access basic configuration commands

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**CMake not found:** Install CMake using your package manager

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install cmake

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install cmake

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S cmake
```

**Permission denied during install:** Make sure to use `sudo` for the install command

**Build fails:** Ensure you have a C compiler installed

```bash
# Install GCC
sudo apt install build-essential  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install gcc              # Fedora/RHEL
```

### Uninstallation Issues

**install_manifest.txt not found:** This file is created during installation. If it's missing, you may need to manually remove the executable:

```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/LEX
```

**Permission denied:** Remember to use `sudo` for uninstall operations
