# Lex

Lex is a **lightweight, simple, and terminal-based text editor**, inspired by GNU Nano. It aims to provide a clean, responsive, and distraction-free editing experience for developers who prefer to stay in the terminal. Unlike full-featured IDEs, Lex focuses on simplicity and essential features only.
